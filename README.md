RPN Calculator - Spring 2014, CSULB

This program allows the user to type in a mathematical formula at the keyboard and produces the answer on the screen. The formula will be typed in INFIX notation and will include only positive integers for the numbers. The operators that are acceptable are the following: + (plus), - (minus), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power). Parenthesis are also allowed.

You should allow the user to type in the equation of his choice and then display the answer on the screen. Display a real answer. (for example: 3 / 2 = 1.5, NOT 1)

ALSO DISPLAY THE POST-FIX EQUATION ON THE SCREEN.

The normal rules of mathematics apply (parenthesis have the highest precedence followed by the ^, followed by * and /, followed by - and +).

Do not allow the program to bomb and warn the user if the equation is wrong. For example: 2 + 43 / * 12 cannot be calculated because there are too many operators.

Allow the user to type in integers from 1 to 99 only. Do not allow negative numbers, or numbers greater than 99, or any characters to be typed in.

Examples:

> 12 + (2 - 4) / 5
		
> 43 + 3 ^ 4 * 2 / 34 - 9
		
> 2 ^ 4 + 34 - 3
